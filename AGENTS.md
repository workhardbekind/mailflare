## Database backup and restore

- Whenever a migration creates, renames, or removes a persisted table, update the backup and restore table lists in the same change, even if the feature is unrelated to backups. Review `BACKUP_TABLES` and `INTERNAL_TABLES` in `src/lib/backups/export.ts`, `BACKUP_TABLE_GROUPS` in `src/lib/backups/table-groups.ts`, and `DatabaseBackupTable` in `src/lib/backups/types.d.ts`.
- Put every backed-up table in exactly one group. Keep `BACKUP_TABLES` in foreign-key dependency order so restore inserts parents before children and deletes them in reverse order. Exclude a table only when its contents are derived or internally managed, and document why.
- When adding a table, check backup and restore behavior both before and after its migration is applied. Keep older full backup documents restorable.
